    <h1> coding journal by the month </h1>
    <br>
    <h2> october </h2>
    <p> This month, I created my portfolio and I created my coding journal. I was inspired by the website "cyclemon.com" for my portfolio because I really liked the flow and the layout. For the coding journal I was inspired by computer terminals in the early days of computer science. </p>
    <h2> september </h2>
    <p> This month, 1 created my click box program as my website diddy. With this program, 1 learned how to make things with css, html and a bit of java. 0riginally the boxes were animated by hovering over them, but because the animations would cause them to move from there area, some of the boxes just kept glitching. So I added java for the animations to start once the boxes were clicked. I did this with event listeners.  </p>
