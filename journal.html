        <h2> April 18th </h2>
        <p> <strong> Before: </strong> To a certain point I think actions are an important reflection on one's character and thus can predict their actions in the future. At the same time, people change themselves and their behavior over the course of their life for better or worse. I'm not sure if someone's actions should be predicted from statistics. I don't think it makes sense to judge one person based on what people from similar background to them did. I also think it gets into the tricky territory of prejudice against race, gender or ethnicity.</p>
        <p> <strong> After: </strong> From my above answers not much has changed about how statistics or past predicts actions, however I did learn more about the use of algorithms and risk assesments. I did know algorithms were being used to divide people into risk categories, but I didn't know the data points that went into it or that high risk people only had 8% chance of commiting a violent crime. I thought that the point made by Georgi Gardiner, a research fellow at Oxford University, encapsulates my thoughts on using statistical evidence. She recognizes that while indivizualized testimony is not totally reliable, the default is true. Also she regards that beyond bias people have an important advantage of stastical evidence, as cognitively and logically making sense of a story. Thus, I think that humans can be aided by statistical evidence, but that the algorithm should be monitored to check for unfair bias. Also I believe that a human judge should be the one making the ultimate desicion regardless of statistical data. </p>
        <h2> April 16th</h2>
        <p> Today I did my first project with p5.js. I read the introduction to the Nature of Code, which discussed random walks and perlin noise. I made this animation inspired by a video of Dan Shiffman on flow chart made with perlin noise. The line of the flow chart each have a different directionality and an animation that makes these lines circles or triangles. It has the efffect of closing blinds, while at the same time having a 3D aspect due to the z-offset. </p>
        <h2> April 12th </h2>
        <p> I made a drawing inspired by the New Yorker, "Dressing for the Surveillance Age" article. I focused on asymetrical makeup which was mentioned in the article. I thought about doing a clothing piece with several different faces or street images (like the ones Google shows for those "Are you a robot? quizzes). I didn't know how to draw that, so I decided to do a shirt that had irregular shapes. I enjoyed the article as it brought my attention to surveillence which is something I don't regularly consider. </p>
        <h2> April 8th </h2>
        <p> I've been working on my spring break code sketch on glitch with Minelle which has been fun. For this weekend, I'm going to start working with p5.js. I think I'll start exploring the code of projects with using it in order to get an idea of it's functionality. I think the independent project that I want to do is using p5.js to make generative art. </p>
        <h2> April 3rd </h2>
        <p> <strong> What are some things you appreciate about this time? </strong> <br> I appreciate having more time with my family and doing activities with them like cooking, watching movies and playing board games. I've also used the extra time to read books for fun and to learn some new things. <br> <strong>What are some things that have been hard for you? </strong> <br> I've been pretty overwhelmed with news and the situation as a whole is constantly stressful. <br> <strong> What is one thing you miss about regular life? </strong> <br> I miss being able to see friends and classmates. I miss being able to go out often without having to wear a mask. I miss how New York normally is, it feels so odd without honking cars and crowded streets. <br> <strong> What is one thing you think you might miss once things go back to normal? </strong> <br> I'm definitely going to miss the later start to school. I think I'll also miss having more time to myself.</p>
        <h2> March 19th</h2>
        <p> I started learning jQuery through Khan Academy and other websites. I made a music album website using animation element as well as using a button to change a page. It's definitely one of my favorite websites as the side step animation effect looks really cool as well as the album covers. I also started making a quiz, but it's been a bit difficult to figure out using jQuery. I think the library is very helpful. I also started learning bootstrap as an extension of CSS and I've been remodeling my portfolio with it!</p>
        <br>
        <h2> March 7th</h2>
        <p> I fixed the animal race website and made the animals speeds or pixels per 1/5 of a second correspond to their miles per hour. Algorithm: x=mph 60/x * 60 /5000 (mile width in px) /5 (px per 200 milliseconds). I can add more animals and I also think it would be interesting to explore the average movement of each animal throughout a prolonged period. </p>
        <br>
        <h2> February 27th</h2>
        <p> I made an animal race website based on the car race, as part of the object assignment. I gave my animals different speeds based on their mph. I think it would be interesting to put mile markers, but I'm not sure how I'd go about that. My background repeats, so perhaps I could use that as a metric for distance. </p>
        <br>
        <h2> February 23rd</h2>
        <p> Today I added my recipe book to my website. I still have to take photos of paella and arroz al horno before I share it with my grandmother. I made the table of contents by making different divs corresponding to a function that made all the contents disappear and a photo and recipe appear. It was a bit hard at first to figure out how to do this, but I found out with display I could just do none. Then the back or "atras" button restored the contents to their initial appearence.</p>
        <br>
        <h2> February 11th</h2>
        <p> Today I linked my dolphin twine interactive story to my personal website. I also linked a feel vs know website, which I did instead of a Valentine's Day card. I based upon the eating animals website and had the idea to use space objects in both pictures and in science fiction drawings. It took a while to figure out what each part of the code does, but it made sense once I started messing around with the code. Then I just used images I wanted to use and linked them to each category, while also using a random generator. </p>
        <br>
        <h2> February 7th</h2>
        <p> I haven't been coding for a while, but this week I made a swarming bee website. Firstly, I coded the style of the bee and made a function to display 30 of them. Then I made them follow the x and y of the mouse movement. This gave the bees a swarming effect and they were grouped in diffrent manners.</p>
        <br>
        <h2> December 22nd</h2>
        <p> For the Xmas gift, it was difficult to find the code for the falling snow that did not already have a background, I found one that was only html and it came out nicely. For the games, I found games that were similar to the ones I wanted to make. I also broadcasted a message so the games had a play image and animation. I also made a message to display the final score. I changed a lot of the "sprites" and background images to make it Xmas themed. </p>
        <br>
        <h2> December 11th</h2>
        <p> I fixed a few things in both of my javascript websites, the background color and the postcard website. It was really satisfying to get them right. I also uploaded them to my website and changed a few visual aspects to it. </p>
        <br>
        <h2> December 6th</h2>
        <p> I improved my twine website by adding a better font and adjusting the images to fill the whole screen. I want to play audio sounds of dolphin clicks and whistles when the dolphins are pressed. I need to export the twine story code to java and add it within the code.</p>
        <br>
         <h2> November 26th</h2>
        <p> I've started making a javascript array program. I chose to make a postcard with images and "hello" from the country. The variables are named the country and then the image url and hello in the language is within each variable. There is an event listner for clicking the postcard and it randomly displays the text. I do not know how to make the url images display a different image each time instead of just the url in text.  </p>
        <br>
        <h2> November 20th</h2>
        <p> I made my javascript website by using a variable that dislays an image of a mango on top of a box. Then I called the variable to appear with the variable i that goes up to 100.   </p>
        <br>
    	<h2> November 12th</h2>
        <p> I finished my code for the fizz buzz program in scratch. I used variable in order to count and used the mod block to determine if the numbers are multiples of 3 and/or 5. </p>
        <br>
        <h2> November 7th</h2>
        <p> I have drawn all my pictures using adobe illustrator. I have not been able to insert these images into my twine style sheet which is strange since I am able to change the background color. I liked drawing the images and being creative with the dolphins expressions and the background. I would also like to add sound to the twine story. </p>
        <br>
        <h2> November 1st</h2>
        <p> I found information about my interactive story about dolphin communication and made an outline for the text using twine. I also connected the information from twine with help from an online tutorial. I'm having trouble with changing the style of the stories with CSS and I found online wiki page of twine very confusing. </p>
        <br>
        <h2> October 19th</h2>
        <p> I redesigned my portfolio and journal to make it more "me". Something I struggled to do was placing the two links for "projects" and "journal". I also created my coding room sketch which has images of furniture and when the mouse hover over it a short description and link pops up. For a long time I couldn't get the image to disappear and only have the solid colored box. This was because I put "background-image" instead of just "background". That was pretty annoying, but once I figured it out, I liked picking out colors and furniture. </p>
        <br>
        <h2> October 10th</h2>
        <p> I created my portfolio and I created my coding journal. I was inspired by the website "cyclemon.com" for my portfolio because I really liked the flow and the layout. For the coding journal I was inspired by computer terminals in the early days of computer science. </p>
        <br>
        <h2> September 19th </h2>
        <p> This month, I created my click box program as my first website. With this program, I learned how to make things with css, html and a bit of javascript. Originally the boxes were animated by hovering over them, but because the animations would cause them to move from there area, some of the boxes just kept glitching. So I added javascript for the keyframe animations to start once the boxes were clicked. I did this with event listeners. </p>
